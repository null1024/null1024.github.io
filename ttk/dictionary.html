<p>This HTML version is now the <em>definitive</em> Toki te Kone dictionary, obsoleting any plain-text versions as of this writing, and taking precedence over any translated versions. </p>
<p>I do try to give a decent rationale for my thought processes for definitions, or warn about any hard edges that you might encounter. Hopefully this dictionary helps you in your Toki te Kone learning experience!</p>

<h3 id="letter_a">-a-</h3>
<ul>
<li id="a"><b>a:</b><br>
(i) expression of surprise, ah!<br>
(part) emphasizes either the previous noun/verb phrase (or the entire sentence if used at the end)<br>
[ex:] <i>musi a.</i> (Funny.)<br>
[notes:] I overuse <i>a</i> a lot. It's pretty <i>pona mute a</i>. :D<br>
</li>
<li id="akesi"><b>akesi:</b><br>
(n) reptile, amphibian, scaly creature or similar<br>
(adj) reptilian, amphibian, scaly<br>
[ex:] <i>akesi pi ma Florida li wawa ta a.</i> (The reptiles of Florida are powerful.) <br>
[notes:] <i>akesi</i> is not a terribly precise term, and that's alright. I kinda wonder if dinosaurs still count as akesi given more recent developments -- I'd still say it, although you could totally also say <i>waso</i> for them, even if <i>waso</i> does immediately conjure up the image of a modern bird.<br>
</li>
<li id="ala"><b>ala:</b><br>
(i) - no!<br>
(n) - nothingness, nothing<br>
(pn) - none<br>
(adj), (adv) - not<br>
(vi) - to not exist<br>
(vt) - to make nothing, to remove, to cause to disappear (from existence)<br>
[ex:] <i>tenpo pimeja pini la, mi lape ala e.</i> (Last night, I didn't sleep.)<br>
[notes:] <i>ala</i> often gets used to make the opposite of a word -- <i>kiwen ala</i> tends to be "soft", for example<br>
</li>
<li id="alasa"><b>alasa:</b><br>
(n) - hunt, search<br>
(adj), (adv) - huntingly, searchingly<br>
(vi), (vt) - to hunt, to search for, to seek<br>
[notes:] <i>alasa</i> tends bring to mind outdoorsy hunting sort of things, like hunting and tracking game. That being said, it still gets used for looking for something in general.<br>
</li>
<!--dirty hack to get both ale and ali as anchor targets-->
<li id="ale"><b id="ali">ale: (ali:)</b><br>
(n) - everything, all<br>
(adj) all of, every<br>
(adv) wholly, completely, entirely<br>
(vi) - ???<br>
(vt) - ???<br>
[ex:] <i>ma ale li pona lukin ta a!</i> (The whole world is beautiful!)
[ex:] <i>mi weka e mani ali no mi lon u esun.</i>
[notes:] If you used <i>ale</i> or <i>ali</i> to mean "life", use <i>pita</i> instead.<br>
[notes:] I don't know what it would mean as a verb.<br>
[notes:] <i>ale</i> and <i>ali</i> are identical in meaning; pick whichever you want or even use both (like I do). That being said, I generally prefer <i>ale</i>. <i>ali</i> was made to prevent confusion with <i>ala</i> for some listeners, and if there is a chance of confusion, then <i>ali</i> is recommended instead.
</li>
<li id="anpa"><b>anpa:</b><br>
(n) bottom, under, floor<br>
(adj) underneath, below, low<br>
(adv) downwardly <br>
(vi), (vt) - to lower<br>
[ex:] telo li tawa anpa kama u sewi. (Rain falls from the sky.) [TODO: might alter sewi]<br>
</li>
<li id="ante"><b>ante:</b><br>
(n) difference, change, alteration<br>
(adj) other, different, changed, altered<br>
(adv) differently<br>
(vi), (vt) to change, to alter, to make different<br>
[ex:] mi ante e lukin pi linja no mi. (I changed how my hair looks.) [TODO: am I using lukin like that?]<br>
[notes:] <br>
</li>
<li id="anu"><b>anu:</b><br>
(part) or<br>
[ex:] sina tawa u tomo sina anu seme? (Are you going to your home?)<br>
[ex:] sina pilin e seme? tomo no mi li pona anu ike? ("What do you feel? Is my house good or bad?")<br>
[notes:] "anu seme" is literally "or what", but is an extremely standard way of asking a question, with no hard feelings.<br>
</li>
<li id="awen"><b>awen:</b><br>
(n) stillness, waiting<br>
(adj) still<br>
(adv) without moving?<br>
(vi) to stay, to wait, to remain<br>
(vt) to keep still, to cause to remain<br>
[ex:] ina li awen lon u supa no mi. (It stayed on my desk.)<br>
[notes:] Unlike how some TP use it, in TK, awen does not mean protection. [TODO: this is probably all wrong and I will change it]<br>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="letter_e">-e-</h3>
<ul>
<li id="e"><b>e:</b><br>
(part) marks the verb; anything after it is the direct object of the verb<br>
[ex:] mi moku e pan sike. (I ate the round bread.)<br>
[notes:] if you have an intransitive verb (a verb that doesn't target anything), you don't need to have e there, but it does mean the verb can be misinterpreted as a noun or an adjective<br>
</li>
<li id="en"><b>en:</b><br>
(part) adds another part to the noun or verb phrase, works just like "and"<br>
[ex:] mi en sina li tawa en moku. (You and I eat and go.)<br>
[notes:] this was changed from Toki Pona to make things simpler, it sadly is basically just English "and" now, even though there was a clear, deliberate attempt to not just do that in TP -- again, this is entirely different to how it is handled in Toki Pona<br>
</li>
<li id="epiku"><b>epiku:</b><br>
(n) coolness (not temperature), greatness, awesomeness, epicness, excellency<br>
(adj) cool, great, awesome, epic, excellent<br>
(adv) awesomely, greatly, epically<br>
(vi) to be awesome, to be great, to be cool<br>
(vt) to make awesome, to make great, to make cool, to improve upon<br>
[ex:] sina epiku ta! (You're great!)<br>
[notes:] Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of this word due to its extreme overlap with "pona", but it's in ku, so it goes in, and it's still pretty useful. Also, any time the word "cool" is mentioned here, it isn't referring to temperature. :P
</li>
<li id="esun"><b>esun:</b><br>
(n) business, market, shop<br>
(adj) relating to business or finance<br>
(adv) financially<br>
(vi) to shop, to do business<br>
(vt) to buy<br>
[ex:] jan Milia li esun e kili. (Milia bought a fruit.)<br>
[notes:] Use a phrase like <i>pana esun e</i> ( financially give) for "to sell".<br>
[notes:] It can get a little confusing since I'm pretty sure bank would be <i>tomo esun</i> (financial building), even though that might be your first instinct to say "store" or "shop". <i>esun</i> on its own as a noun means that.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="letter_i">-i-</h3>
<ul>
<li id="ijo"><b>ijo:</b><br>
(n) thing, item, object<br>
(adj) physical<br>
(adv) physically, materially<br>
(vt)  to thingify (TODO: what does that mean???)<br>
[notes:] All the non-noun forms just feel weird to me. This is the problem with giving a definition for <em>every</em> part of speech that a word could be in -- even if it might end up making sense there, you might not know how to explain it.
</li>
<li id="ike"><b>ike:</b><br>
(n) badness, evilness, wrongness<br>
(adj) bad, evil, wrong (as opposed to good, rather than as opposed to correct)<br>
(adv) badly, poorly<br>
(vi) to do bad, to be bad<br>
(vt) to do bad to something, to harm<br>
[notes:] Toki te Kone doesn't make "ike" have an opinion about complexity, although I suspect a TK speaker to possibly still agree with complexity being wrong. Also, although all these definitions sound prety harsh, you can just be like "na li ike" (that is bad) and not just immediately be like "oh man, that thing is eeeeevil", it isn't always that strong.
</li>
<li id="ilo"><b>ilo:</b><br>
(n) tool, equipment, electronics, device, machine<br>
(adj) mechanical<br>
(adv) mechanically, electronically<br>
(v) to mechanize<br>
[ex:] ilo mi te pakala e kiwen li wawa ta a. (My stone breaking machine is powerful.)<br>
[notes:] as a noun, it doesn't necessarily imply something is electronic or mechanized or whatever, but I suspect a lot of things described with it will be; it feels a bit rough that all the other word forms are in fact about mechanical things, but whatever<br>
</li>
<li id="insa"><b>insa</b><br>
(n) innards, inside area<br>
(adj) inside of<br>
(adv) inwardly<br>
(vi) to go inside<br>
(vt) to go inside of<br>
(prep) to be inside of<br>
[ex:] ona li insa u tomo no ona. (They're inside of their house.)<br>
[notes:] doesn't exactly mean stomach like in Toki Pona but you might end up saying something like "insa mi li pilin ike e"<br>
</b>
</ul>
<h3 id="letter_j">-j-</h3>
<ul>
* jaki<br>
(n) filth, dirt, garbage<br>
(adj) filthy, dirty, nasty, disgusting<br>
(adv) filthily, nastily, disgustingly<br>
(vi) to be filthy<br>
(vt) to make filthy, to dirty<br>
[ex:] na li jaki ta a! (That's filthy!)<br>
<br>
* jan<br>
(n) person<br>
(adj) personal, person-like<br>
(adv) personally, in the way a person would<br>
[ex:] jan pona no mi li wile tawa u ma Tosi. (My friend wants to go to Germany.)<br>
[notes:] person doesn't have to mean human! if there were literal space aliens that ended up saying "mi mute li wile toki tawa u jan lawa no sina.", you would still probably call them jan. A "jan" is someone you could (even if only theoretically -- actual physical constraints do not apply) hold a conversation with. If we ever get an AI that is actually self-aware, I would probably call it "jan". Maybe "jan ilo", but "jan" first.<br>
<br>
* jasima<br>
(n) mirror, reflection, opposite<br>
(adj) opposite<br>
(adv) oppositely<br>
(vi), (vt) to reverse, to mirror, to make opposite, to flip over<br>
[ex:] mi jasima e lipu no mi. (I flipped over my book)<br>
[notes:] remember, all the ku words are in TK<br>
<br>
<li><b>jelo:</b><br>
(n) yellow<br>
(adj) yellow<br>
(vi), (vt) to yellow, to become yellow<br>
[notes:] All the color words will be something like this. Also, I don't know how to use it as an adverb. Would that even make sense?<br>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="letter_k">-k-</h3>
<ul>
* kala<br>
(n) sea creature, fish<br>
(adj) fish-like<br>
(adv) fishily (eg, "mi tawa kala e" would probably be to swim -- "I move like a fish")<br>
(vi), (vt) to fish, to trawl<br>
[ex:] tenpo suno kama la mi moku e kala mute. (Next morning, I'll eat a lot of fish.)<br>
[notes:] pretty much any primarily aquatic animal is described by kala, even like dolphins<br>
<br>
* kalama<br>
(n) sound, audio<br>
(adj) loud<br>
(adv) loudly<br>
(vi) to make sound<br>
(vt) to apply sound to, to project sound to<br>
[ex:] ilo kalama no mi li wawa i.<br>
<br>
* kama<br>
(pv) to be in the process of, to do later<br>
(n) arrival, happening, coming<br>
(adj) future, coming<br>
(vi) to come<br>
(vt) to cause, to summon, to bring about<br>
(prep) origin of, source of, from<br>
[ex:] mi kama sona e toki Nijon (I'm learning Japanese.) (lit: I come to know the Japanese lanugage)<br>
[ex:]<br>
[notes:] pre-verbs are a bit of a mess; also kama in TK replaces tan as meaning "from", tan now means strictly "because of" or "for this reason" now<br>
<br>
* kasi<br>
(n) plant, herb, shrub, something plant-like even if it isn't literally a plant (eg, a sponge might be describable as "kasi no telo" -- water's plant)<br>
(adj) botanical, herbal, plant-like<br>
(adv) botanically, herbally, plant-like<br>
(vi), (vt) ???<br>
<br>
* ken<br>
(pv) ability<br>
(n) possibility, potential, ability, chance<br>
(adj) possible<br>
(vi) to be able, to be permitted<br>
(vt) to allow, to permit<br>
[ex:] mi ken lape (I can sleep)<br>
[ex:] mi ken! (I can!)<br>
[ex:] ken la, ale li pona a. (Maybe everything will be great.)<br>
[notes:] you'll probably see "ken la" a lot at the start of sentences, this means "maybe" or "possibly"; I have no idea if I have the definition/usage for the verb forms set up right, how would I even use ken as a transitive verb?<br>
<br>
* kepeken<br>
(n) use<br>
(adj) useful<br>
(vi), (vt) to use<br>
(prep) using, via<br>
[ex:] mi tawa u tomo no sina kepeken u tomo tawa mi. ("I went to your house using my car.")<br>
<br>
* kijetesantakalu<br>
(n) animal in the superfamily Musteloidea, namely raccoons<br>
(adj), (adv) like a racoon/other musteloid<br>
(vi), (vt) ??? you might be able to argue that "mi li kijetesantakalu e sina" would be "I racoonify you" but I don't like it one bit<br>
[notes:] this is arguably a joke word inherited from TP -- but it is still a word, and you should not be surprised if someone actually uses it<br>
<br>
* kili<br>
(n) fruit, vegetable, maybe nut<br>
(adj), (adv) like a fruit/nut/vegetable<br>
(vi), (vt) ???<br>
<br>
* kin<br>
(adj), (adv) also, too<br>
<br>
* kipisi<br>
(n) cut, split, division<br>
(adj) cut, split<br>
(adv) divisively <br>
(vi), (vt) to cut, to split, to sever, to divide into pieces<br>
<br>
* kiwen<br>
(n) rock, stone, metal, other hard material<br>
(adj) hard, tough, durable, metallic, rocky<br>
(adv) ???<br>
(vi) to be hard, to be tough, to be durable<br>
(vt) to harden, to toughen, to make durable<br>
[notes:] should really figure out a distinction for metals at least, that seems important; I really should have a separate word for metal vs rock<br>
<br>
* ko<br>
(n) clay, dough, something semi-solid<br>
(adj) semi-solid, doughy, squishy<br>
(adv) like clay<br>
(vi), (vt) to squish<br>
[notes:] doesn't this describe sand in Toki Pona? TODO: double check; if so, it still doesn't in Toki te Kone lol<br>
<br>
* kokosila<br>
(n) the speaking of a language other than Toki te Kone in a group that speaks it<br>
(adj) like one who speaks a language other than Toki te Kone in a group that speaks it<br>
(vi) to speak a language other than Toki te Kone in a group that speaks it<br>
[notes:] I don't actually like this word much, but like, it is in the Toki Pona nimi ku suli, so it goes in<br>
[notes:] part of me is tempted to generalize the word to meaning "to speak a language other than what is expected to be spoken"<br>
<br>
* kon<br>

(adj) gaseous, spiritual, wispy, breathy<br>

(vi) to breathe<br>
<br>
* ku<br>
(n) the official Toki Pona Dictionary<br>
(adj) from the Toki Pona Dictionary<br>
(adv) like found in the Toki Pona Dictionary<br>
(vi) to interact with or otherwise utilize the Toki Pona Dictionary<br>
(vt) to utilize the Toki Pona Dictionary upon someone or something (eg, teach with it)<br>
[notes:] this is totally a legacy word and the meaning has not been altered to refer to Toki te Kone; I am deeply tempted to add my own word(s) to refer to the official Toki te Kone documentation<br>
<br>
* kule<br>
(n) color, pigment<br>
(adj) colorful, colored, painted, pigmented<br>
(adv) colorfully<br>
(vi), (vt) to color, to paint, to apply pigment to<br>
<br>

(adj) aural<br>
(adv) aurally, sonically<br>
(vi), (vt) to hear, to listen, to understand<br>
<br>
</ul>
<h3 id="letter_l">-l-</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>la:</b><br>
(part) marks the end of the context phrase; no longer used to create "if __ then __" statements, use "so" for that.<br>
[notes:] la gets used for a lot of things, most notably specifying time
</li>
* lanpan<br>
(n) seizure (of goods), theft<br>
(adj) stolen, seized, taken<br>
(adv) in a way relating to seizure (of goods), thievingly<br>
(vi), (vt) to take, to steal, to grab<br>

<br>

(n) sleep, rest, relaxation<br>
(adj) resting, sleeping<br>
(adv) sleepily<br>
(vi) to sleep, to rest<br>
(vt) to knock out, to cause to sleep<br>
<br>
* laso<br>
(n) blue, aqua, sometimes green<br>
[notes:] laso sewi is a nice sky blue, laso kasi is a definite green, but in general, laso is largely a blueish tone; part of me wants to use "laso no jan Miku" for aqua blue but like, that's too goofy<br>
<br>
* lawa<br>
(n) head, mind, brain, control, rule, ruler<br>
(adj) controlling, leading<br>
(adv) controllingly<br>
(vi), (vt) to lead, to guide, to control, to rule<br>

(n) internet, network, any kind of bi-directional electronic or radio communication system<br>
(adj) regarding the internet<br>
(adv) "internetly", like the internet<br>
(vi), (vt) ???<br>
[notes:] was deeply tempted to not include this since it's not a nimi ku suli but it is genuinely too useful; Toki te Kone is a language of the internet as well and needs a way to express that in one word<br>
[notes:] kone gets used in a lot of places where some TP speakers might have used linluwi
<br>
* lipu<br>
(n) book<br>
<br>
* loje<br>
(n), (adj) red<br>
<br>

<br>
* lukin<br>
(n) eye<br>
(adj) visual<br>
(adv) visually<br>
(vi), (vt) to see<br>
[notes:] [TODO -- do I want to alter this to refer to appearance? we do have oko for eye/sight, but like, it doesn't feel right]<br>
<br>
* lupa<br>
(n) hole, indent, door, opening, orifice<br>
(adj) holey, indented,<br>
(vi), (vt) to create a hole/indent<br>
<br>
* ma<br>
(n) land, area, place, outside, location<br>
[notes:] although I'm not 100% sure if it definitely implies outside in Toki Pona, you can totally refer to a large indoor space as "ma" in Toki te Kone<br>
<br>
* mama<br>
(n) parent, originator, creator<br>
<br>
* mani<br>
(n) money<br>
[notes:] still not sure if I should keep the meaning of like, cattle -- it is confusing every time I see it, but it is both historical and funny<br>
<br>

(adj) feminine<br>
<br>
* meso<br>
(n) middle, center<br>

<br>
<br>
* monsi<br>
(n), (adj) rear, behind<br>
(adv) ???<br>
(vi), (vt) ???<br>

<br>

[ex:] ilo toki te kone no mi li pona lukin a. -- My phone looks great. <br>

<br>
* noka<br>
(n) foot, leg<br>
<br>
* o<br>
(part) calls upon someone/something and optionally marks a command/request upon them; if the part before o is omitted, interpret it as "sina o ..."<br>

(adj) broken, messed up, damaged<br>
(adv) brokenly<br>
(vi) to mess up, to make a mistake<br>
(vt) to break, to damage<br>
[notes:] when used as a swear... it arguably isn't that bad of one, but IRL I will shout "pakala mute a!" like if I'm yelling "fucking hell" lol; also, I kind of feel like you can just pretend the word means "oops" and you're just like "OOPS" or "oh, I oopsed it" or "I'm going to 'oops' your face if you don't shut up" (something like "sina toki so mi pakala e sinpin no sina!", even if that's not one-to-one)<br>
[notes:] "mi pakala" is the standard way to apologize. <br>
<br>
* pali<br>
(n) work, project, creation, effort<br>
<br>
* pi<br>
(part) groups a phrase together, like "of" in English<br>
[ex:] kili pi seli mute (fruit of much heat, pepper)<br>
<br>
<li id="pilin"><b>pilin:</b><br>
(n) feeling, sensation, heart, touch<br>
(adj) feeling (emotion)<br>
(adv) emotionally<br>
(vi), (vt) to touch, to feel (physically or emotionally)<br>
[notes:] as of this writing, the concept "to think" is separated from <i>pilin</i> in Toki te Kone, unlike in Toki Pona.<br>
[notes:] vaguely tempted to separate how it means heart too, but I doubt I'll do it
</li>
<li id="pimeja"><b>pimeja:</b><br>
(n) darkness, blackness
(adj) dark, black, shadowed, unlit
(adv) darkly, dimly
(vi), (vt) to darken, to cast a shadow

(n) life<br>
(adj) living<br>
(adv) like that which lives<br>
(vi) to live<br>
(vt) to cause to live<br>
[ex:] mama meli no mi li pita e mi. (My mother gave birth to me; lit: my mother caused me to live.)<br>
[notes:] really lazy word origin but whatever -- this might change so don't grow too attached/angry :P<br>
</li>
<li id="poka"><b>poka:</b><br>
(n) side<br>
(adj) next to, neighboring, beside, near
</li>

(n) goodness, positivity<br>
(adj) good, correct, positive<br>
(adv) well, correctly<br>
(vi), (vt) to fix<br>
[notes:] No longer means "simple" like in Toki Pona. This is a core change in Toki te Kone. In the philosophy of TK, simple is usually to be lauded as <i>pona</i>, but isn't always.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="letter_s">-s-</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>so:</b><br>
(part) creates an if __ then __ sentence; completely replaces that use of <i>la</i> from Toki Pona<br>
[ex:] mi lape so mi pilin pona. (If I sleep, I feel good.)<br>
[notes:] This word was was supposed to be based on English "so", but it doesn't really mean what "so" does in English; I'm totally keeping it anyway because it flows well and leaves <i>la</i> free.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="letter_t">-t-</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>to:</b><br>
(part) directly combines another sentence onto another one, putting it entirely into the spot where to is used<br>
[ex:] <i>mi toki e to "moku ni li ike tawa u mi".</i> (I said, "I don't like this food.")<br>
[ex:] <i>ona li wile e to tenpo no tomo sona li pini.</i> (He wishes that school time would end.)<br>
[ex:] <i>mi pilin e to ale li pona.</i> (I feel that everything is good.)<br>
[notes:] The preceding sentence is represented in Toki Pona as <i>mi pilin e ni: ale li pona.</i><br>
[notes:] This word exists entirely to improve the flow of Toki te Kone. You can still use <i>ni</i> to refer to the next sentence, and ni can be used in places where <i>to</i> cannot. However, since <i>to</i> joins the two sentences into one, the resulting sentence is spoken as one.<br>
[notes:] I have been on the fence about this word because it is somewhat complicated to explain, but it has been consistently too useful to replace.
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="numbers">numbers:</h2>
<p>All numbers other than <i>lei</i> and <i>wan</i> follow the same pattern as used in <i>tu</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li id="lei"><b>lei:</b> (0)<br>
(n) zero<br>
(adj) none of, zero<br>
(vi), (vt) to make zero, to remove
</li>
<li id="wan"><b>wan:</b> (1)<br>
(n) one<br>
(adj) one of, single, one<br>
(adv) singly<br>
(vi), (vt) to become or make singular, to unify
</li>
<li id="tu"><b>tu:</b> (2)<br>
(n) two<br>
(adj) two of, two<br>
(adv) doubly<br>
(vi), (vt) to multiply by two<br>
[notes:] <i>mi tu e ni</i> would not mean "to split", but rather, "to double". Use <i>kipisi tu</i> for split in half, or <i>kipisi oto</i> to divide into eighths.
</li>
<li id="milu"><b>milu:</b> (thousands separator)<br>
(n) thousand<br>
(adj) thousand of, thousand<br>
(adv) thousandfold<br>
(vi), (vt) to multiply by a thousand<br>
[notes:] <i>milu</i> is primarily used as the thousands separator, but it can be used on its own. That being said, saying <i>wan milu</i> for 1000 instead of just <i>milu</i> is preferred.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus,</p>
<ul>
<li id="tuli"><b>tuli:</b> (3)</li>
<li id="jon"><b>jon:</b> (4)</li>
<li id="sinko"><b>sinko:</b> (5)</li>
<li id="loku"><b>loku:</b> (6)</li>
<li id="nana"><b>nana:</b> (7)</li>
<li id="oto"><b>oto:</b> (8)</li>
<li id="kiju"><b>kiju:</b> (9)</li>
</ul>
<p>all follow the same pattern as tu. Thus, <i>oto</i> is "eight" as a noun, "eight of" as an adjective, and "to multiply by eight" as a verb.</p>
<p>Making larger numbers is done by putting the digits next to each other ("wan lei" would be ten: 1 0 -> 10). Every 1000x increase, add "milu" after (5,630 -> sinko milu ). You can skip any leading zeroes in a group: <i>wan tu milu wan tuli</i> would be 1 2 , 1 3 -> 12,013. <i>kiju milu milu</i> would be nine million.</p>
<p>Keeping with the spirit of Toki Pona, if you hear yourself saying <i>milu</i> more than once, that number is certainly too big to make any sense of. I never really liked how saying a number as small as thirty eight is hard in Toki Pona (<i>mute luka luka luka tu wan</i> -- 20 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 +1), but I do understand the rationale. <i>toki pona la, nanpa li ike. taso, toki te kone la, nanpa li pona lili ta.</i></p>
<p>A previous version of this file mentioned the number 42 in Toki Pona, which is actually simpler than I remembered (<i>mute mute tu</i>), but you get some quite complicated numbers before then.</p>
<p>As an aside, in Toki te Kone, 38 would just be <i>tuli oto</i>, and 42 would just be <i>jon tu</i>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ideas for words:</h2>
<p>This list is for words I feel aren't well represented, but I'm still deciding on what they should be or if they should even be in Toki te Kone.</p>
<ul>
<li>think (separate from <i>pilin</i>); this would be a fairly major change</li>
<li>trial, examination, ordeal, challenge, test</li>
<li>simple (separate from <i>pona</i>; this is a major philosophical difference that Toki te Kone has versus Toki Pona)</li>
<li>complex (separate from <i>ike</i>; see above)</li>
<li>above (separate from <i>sewi</i>)</li>
<li>memory, to remember</li>
<li>chance, risk, gamble (<i>ken</i> exists, but doesn't really convey the meaning I want)</li>
<li>heavy? (not sure, in TP I use <i>suli</i>)</li>
<li>result? there might be a better way to say this in TP</li>
</ul>
