Toki te Kone -- lessons

===

Introduction:

Toki te Kone is a constructed language designed to expand upon Toki Pona.

The language is designed to be pretty easy to pick up for a Toki Pona speaker, but also designed to be easy to understand for someone who is new to the language to listen to or read and understand it without too much trouble.

I chose Toki Pona as a base because I love the language quite a bit and because it has a relatively decent speaker count due to its small size. Toki te Kone is full of changes that I'd want in Toki Pona but would both break from the spirit of Toki Pona and no one would adopt them anyway.

If there was one singular change out of everything here that I would make to Toki Pona, it would be the addition of the particle 'u' to mark prepositions. This change alone accomplishes 90% of 

The name Toki te Kone means "Language that Connects". Toki Pona's initial intent was to be a meditative language to simplify one's thoughts and manages to be remarkably good for communication, but Toki te Kone is explicitly intended as a simple and fun language to talk to others with. It does not intend to simplify thought, although it will probably influence things anyway due to its minimalism.

Toki te Kone has no real ambition of being an IAL, and due to my limited linguistic ability, new words are mostly pulled from the short list of languages I have attempted to study, rather than any real attempt to be fair and take from a wide variety of sources.

Toki te Kone still holds minimalism in somewhat high regard, and an effort is made to keep the language far smaller than the vast majority of other constructed languages, let alone natural languages.

I hope you have fun using Toki te Kone. Teach your friends and family, teach random people you find, spread the word of Toki te Kone tawa u jan ale pi ma sike ni!
