<h2>Blog:</h2>

<p>This page is for various musings on whatever tickles my fancy. Like everything else on the site, the date might have nothing to do with when it was actually posted, just when I last updated it. The newest entries are at the top.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="blogs/0000001-own-site.html">You should have your own site, it's great.</a> [<time datetime="2023-06-29">6/29/2023mdy</time>, updated 6/30/2023mdy]</li>
</ul>
<p>I am too lazy to use a templating engine (which would actually save me a fair bit of work, but I would need to learn how it works, and that is effort). As a result, older blog entries may look a bit odd since they won't be updated for any theme or layout changes. I've designed the site so theme changes should still look fine, but I have no idea what the future holds.</p>
<p>This page might also get pretty long depending on how much I decide to blog. Oh well.</p>
