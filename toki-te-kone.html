<p><i>toki! o kama pona tawa u lipu linluwi no mi! nimi no mi li jan Nalu. mi wile e to sina li kama sona e toki te kone! toki ni li pona mute a tawa u mi; kin la, mi wile e to sina li pilin sama!</i></p>

<h3>About the language:</h3>
<p>Toke te Kone (the "Language that Connects") is a conlang I am making that is based on Sonja Lang's <a href="https://tokipona.org/">Toki Pona<img src="external.png" alt="(external)" width="12" height="12"></a>. It features a fairly simple grammar with few exceptions and a short word list (under 300, period, and likely under 220).</p>
<p>My goal with it is to make a more "general-purpose" language that focuses on fostering communication and being able to express a lot of ideas despite its size. Toki te Kone is not Toki Pona, and has its own philosophy regarding complexity vs simplicity, but it still prefers minimalism. Being the smallest doesn't matter, but it is dramatically harder to teach your friend a thousand words than like, three hundred.</p>
<p>Toki te Kone also intends to be fairly well defined. It should be easy to learn what constitutes a valid Toki te Kone sentence and I hope to provide extensive examples, something I wish had been done for Toki Pona in <i>pu</i> or <i>ku</i>. I do not have <i>su</i> yet, but it is very gladdening to see that there is now a long-form officially produced translation work in Toki Pona.</p>
<p>Toki te Kone is not intended to replace Toki Pona, and at times, the documentation for Toki te Kone expects at least a passing familiarity with it. Currently, I suggest anyone interested in Toki te Kone look into Toki Pona first. Eventually, I hope Toki te Kone can stand on its own, but it is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>For those who already know Toki Pona, Toki te Kone includes all of the 137 "nimi ku suli" found in the official Toki Pona Dictionary ("ku"), along with several entirely new words. It features a number system which can be explained in five minutes. It adds additional grammar to allow you to make your intended meaning clearer, but generally doesn't force you to. It adds a marker to prepositions, which makes them dramatically easier to teach and to understand. In general, Toki te Kone tries to expand Toki Pona in ways that are unlikely to happen, but would be useful.</p>
<p>Overall, I hope Toke te Kone can be enjoyable and useful for you! Have fun! <i>o musi pona kepeken u toki te kone!</i></p>

<h3>Some samples:</h3>
<p>These indicate some of the many changes and additions to Toki te Kone from Toki Pona. Due to being in progress, the meaning of the words may shift as I work on the language. In addition, as things change, the meaning of some of these sentences may drift from their original intent.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>na li ijo no mi anu seme?</i> -- Is that mine?<br>You can also say, <i>na li ijo no mi ala mi?</i></li>
<li><i>kijetesantakalu tuli sinko li kama tawa u mi.</i> -- Thirty five raccoons (or other musteloids) are coming to me.</li>
<li><i>tenpo ale la mi wile e to jan ale li pona.</i> -- All the time, I want everyone to be good.</li>
<li><i>wawa nasa no jan Mijuki li epiku ta a! ona li ken ante e ona tawa u jan utala pi lawa pona!</i> -- Miyuki's strange powers are cool! She can transform into a warrior of justice!</li>
<li><i>mi moku e kili pona so sijelo no mi li kama wawa.</i> -- If I eat good fruits, my body will become strong.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Documentation:</h3>
<p>Everything here is a work in progress, and nothing is complete as of this writing. Sentences may just end, sections may be empty, things may be wrong. <strong>Everything</strong> here is subject to change. All text files here expect word wrap.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="ttk/dictionary.html">dictionary<img src="construction.png" alt="(under construction)" width="12" height="12"></a> -- work in progress. Missing a lot, but what is there is reasonably up-to-date with how I view the language. Now in HTML format. Generally gets updated more than the others. Currently, if you're interested in learning Toki te Kone, <strong>read this page first</strong>. This is the most up-to-date and accurate reference for the language.</li>
<li><a href="text/toki-te-kone-20230511.txt">main documentation<img src="text.png" alt="(text file)" width="12" height="12"><img src="construction.png" alt="(under construction)" width="12" height="12"></a> -- work in progress as of 5/11/2023mdy. Quite out of date, hastily edited as of this writing for publication -- much of it hasn't been updated since late 2022. Contains a lot of grammar info that the other files don't have yet... but it also contains things that aren't true anymore. At some point, I'll replace this.</li>

Very out of date. <em>Very</em> unfinished. Desperately needs to be remade.</li>

<p>In (semi-literal) English:</p>
Hi! I'm Null (null1024).<br>
I want to teach you Toki te Kone!<br>
<br>
Toki te Koni is an easy language and a language that has few words. You can learn Toki te Kona in little time.<br>
<br>
Toki te Kona comes from Toki Pona because Toki Pona doesn't have many of the words I want. I somewhat think that Toki Pona's littleness is a bit bad.<br>
<br>
...those words were a bit goofy. :P The sound "li" was used a lot.<br>
<br>
I want you to learn Toki te Kone, you to come to love Toki te Kone, and you to teach the way of Toki te Kona to your friends. Have fun! Learn! Speak well (using Toki te Kone lol)!
<br>
Toki te Kone wishes not to control/replace Toki Pona, but I feel that Toki Pona can't say all the words I have.
