<h3>About the language:</h3>
<p>Toke te Kone (the "Language that Connects") is a conlang I am making that is based on Toki Pona.</p>
<p>My goal with it is to make a more "general-purpose" language that focuses on fostering communication and being able to express a lot of ideas despite its size. Toki te Kone is not Toki Pona, and has its own philosophy regarding complexity vs simplicity, but it still aims for minimalism.</p>
<p>For those who already know Toki Pona, Toki te Kone includes all of the 137 "nimi ku suli" found in the official Toki Pona Dictionary ("ku"), along with several entirely new words. It features a number system which can be explained in five minutes. It adds additional grammar to allow you to make your intended meaning clearer, but generally doesn't force you to. It adds a marker to prepositions, which makes them dramatically easier to teach and to understand. In general, Toki te Kone tries to expand Toki Pona in ways that are unlikely to happen, but would be useful.</p>
<p>Overall, I hope Toke te Kone can be enjoyable and useful for you! Have fun!</p>
