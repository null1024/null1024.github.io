<h3>About the language:</h3>
<p>Toke te Kone (the "Language that Connects") is a conlang I am making that is based on <a href="https://tokipona.org/">Toki Pona<img src="external.png" alt="(external)" width="12" height="12"></a>. It features a fairly simple grammar with few exceptions and a short word list (under 300, period, and likely under 220).</p>
<p>My goal with it is to make a more "general-purpose" language that focuses on fostering communication and being able to express a lot of ideas despite its size. Toki te Kone is not Toki Pona, and has its own philosophy regarding complexity vs simplicity, but it still prefers minimalism. Being the smallest doesn't matter, but it is dramatically harder to teach your friend a thousand words than like, three hundred.</p>
<p>Toki te Kone is not intended to replace Toki Pona, and at times, the documentation for Toki te Kone expects at least a passing familiarity with it. Currently, I suggest anyone interested in Toki te Kone look into Toki Pona first.</p>
<p>For those who already know Toki Pona, Toki te Kone includes all of the 137 "nimi ku suli" found in the official Toki Pona Dictionary ("ku"), along with several entirely new words. It features a number system which can be explained in five minutes. It adds additional grammar to allow you to make your intended meaning clearer, but generally doesn't force you to. it adds a marker to prepositions, which makes them dramatically easier to teach and to understand. In general, Toki te Kone tries to expand Toki Pona in ways that are unlikely to happen, but would be useful.</p>
<p>Overall, I hope Toke te Kone can be enjoyable and useful for you! Have fun! <i>o musi pona kepeken u toki te kone!</i></p>

<p>All files here are works in progress, and none of them are complete as of this writing. Sentences may just end, sections may be empty, things may be wrong. <strong>Everything</strong> here is subject to change. These files expect word wrap.</p>
