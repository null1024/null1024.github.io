<h2>Why I'm making Toki te Kone.</h2>

<p>In the previous article, I talked about how much I like Toki Pona and why I hope more people learn it. That being said, I'm making my own version of the language, one with major, breaking changes. Even though I <strong>love</strong> Toki Pona, as I use it, I'm constantly finding things I want to change. I advocate for it because it is already in relatively wide use and has existing resources, but often, I want something less philosophical and more practical.</p>
<p>I didn't really touch on Toki Pona's philosophy much in the last article and I should have. I don't disagree with it, but sometimes, I don't really feel like agreeing with it. As a result, Toki te Kone's philosophy is fundamentally different from Toki Pona's. Where Toki Pona seeks to simplify things to their core value and eliminate excess, Toki te Kone is explicitly made to be easy to use and easy to understand. It's aggressively pragmatic, to the point where I would actively disagree with introducing many its changes and new words to Toki Pona. Toki te Kone doesn't treat ambiguity as a feature, while Toki Pona embraces the ambiguity found in phrases like <i>mi moku</i> -- do you eat? Are you food? The latter interpretation isn't likely, but it remains <em>entirely valid</em>. Admittedly, Toki te Kone still allows this sentence with all its ambiguity, but it also provides ways to explicitly state what you mean. <i>mi moku e</i> in Toki te Kone is explicitly "I eat". <i>mi moku ta</i> in Toki te Kone is explicitly  "I am edible" (as of this writing at least, since Toki te Kona <em>is</em> still being developed).</p>
<p>Toki Pona also has the issue of having too little grammar in certain spots, and I would at least consider advocating for some of these changes to the language. In particular, prepositions are unmarked, making it much more difficult for the person listening to the sentence to parse it since they're also used as nouns and verbs and adjectives and adverbs, and unlike those, you can't easily determine them by position alone. <i>mi tawa e jan pona mi lon tomo tawa mi tawa tomo esun.</i> ("I'm taking my friends in my car to the bank.") Toki te Kone uses the particle <i>u</i> to mark prepositions, changing the sentence into <i>mi tawa e jan pona no mi lon u tomo tawa no mi tawa u tomo esun</i>. The use of <i>no</i> in the sentence marks possession (and while useful, I don't think Toki Pona seriously needs it), while the use of <i>u</i> makes it clear that <i>lon</i> and <i>tawa</i> are prepositions, vastly easing the mental load of distinguishing the use of <i>tawa</i>.</p>
<p>My biggest hurdle with teaching Toki Pona to my IRL friends, apart from the word order for adjectives being backwards to English, has been related to prepositions. They were easily the hardest thing for me to learn about the grammar too.</p>
<p>One of the major changes to Toki te Kone is the new <i>to</i> particle that significantly improves sentence flow. A sentence like <i>mi olin e ni: jan pona mi li pana e moku tawa mi</i> ("I love that my friend gave me food", literally "I love this: my friend gave food to me") ends up being quite jarring to say, the grammar forcing you to split it into two sentence. </p>
