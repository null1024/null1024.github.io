<h2>About:</h2>
<hr>
<p>Hello! I'm null1024 (<i>jan Nalu</i>). I like making music, programming, and a few other things. I've been on the internet for far too long, but I haven't had a website in years. I also slightly wish I had picked a different name back in like 2004/5/6, because there are definitely at least two other people who use the name.
<p>Oh well. I'm not changing it now. I'm close to 20 years with it, and I'm pretty sure I was first. :P<p>
<p>Currently, my main project is <a href="toki-te-kone.html">Toki te Kone</a>, a modification of the conlang Toki Pona that alters the grammar to be a bit less ambiguous, adjusts some word definitions, and adds a handful of new words. It is very much a work in progress, but there is some work in progress documentation available.</p>
<p>In addition, I've worked on a lot of music over at <a href="https://battleofthebits.org/barracks/Profile/null1024/">Battle of the Bits<img src="external.png" alt="(external)" width="12" height="12"></a>. Most of the earlier stuff isn't that great -- I've been at this for over 15 years, but my music from about 2017 onward is much better than from before then.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I'll add more to this site. I've done a lot over the years, but it's quite scattered all over the place, so I'm trying to consolidate it into one place.</p>
<p>I added a section for <a href="blog.html">blog posts</a>, and I hope to write fairly frequently.</p>
<p>Any link with a '<img src="external.png" alt="(external)" width="12" height="12">' icon next to it leaves this site, any link with a '<img src="text.png" alt="(text file)" width="12" height="12">' icon next to it is an unformatted text file, and any link with a '<img src="download.png" alt="(download)" width="12" height="12">' icon next to it is a direct download. In addition, the '<img src="construction.png" alt="(under construction)" width="12" height="12">' icon will be used for anything severely unfinished.
