<h2>About me:</h2>
<hr>
<p>Hello! I'm null1024 (<i>jan Nalu</i>). I like making music, programming, and a few other things. I've been on the internet for far too long, but I haven't had a website in years. I also slightly wish I had picked a different name back in like 2004/5/6, because there are definitely at least two other people who use the name. Very annoying, that.
<p>Oh well. I'm not changing it now. I'm close to 20 years with it, and I'm pretty sure I was first. :P<p>

<h2>Recent updates:</h2>

<h3>Latest update:</h3>
<ul>
<li>New blog entry, detailing <a href="blogs/0000005-games-i-like-aqua-rush.html">an arcade game I like called Aqua Rush</a>. It's a very cool puzzle game by Namco.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Previous updates:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A few updates to the Toki te Kone pages. I really need to work on it a lot more. There are a few major changes that I am considering that I am not certain of, so I don't want to rush, but I definitely also haven't been working on it as much as I should have. :P</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="links.html#new_links">links</a> page. Some new links, minor cleanup of dead links to point to the Wayback Machine, and I deleted my Twitter/X and Bluesky accounts, so they're gone.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page. In particular, I'm working on an extremely low-budget controller for Beatmania IIDX. Details can be found <a href="https://github.com/null1024/Pico-Game-Controller-cheap/tree/main">over on GitHub<img src="construction.png" alt="(under construction)" width="12" height="12"><img src="external.png" alt="(external)" width="12" height="12"></a>.</li>
<li>New blog entry about <a href="blogs/0000004-learn-toki-pona.html">how much I like Toki Pona</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Currently, my main project is <a href="toki-te-kone.html">Toki te Kone</a>, a modification of the conlang Toki Pona that alters the grammar to be a bit less ambiguous, adjusts some word definitions, and adds a handful of new words. It is very much a work in progress, but there is some work in progress documentation available.</p>
<p>In addition, I've worked on a lot of music over at <a href="https://battleofthebits.com/barracks/Profile/null1024/">Battle of the Bits<img src="external.png" alt="(external)" width="12" height="12"></a>. Most of the earlier stuff isn't that great -- I've been at this for over 15 years, but my music from about 2017 onward is much better than from before then.</p>
<p>I've done a lot over the years, but it's quite scattered all over the place, so I'm trying to consolidate it into one place.</p>
<p>Any link with a '<img src="external.png" alt="(external)" width="12" height="12">' icon next to it leaves this site, any link with a '<img src="text.png" alt="(text file)" width="12" height="12">' icon next to it is an unformatted text file, and any link with a '<img src="download.png" alt="(download)" width="12" height="12">' icon next to it is a direct download. In addition, the '<img src="construction.png" alt="(under construction)" width="12" height="12">' icon will be used for anything severely unfinished.
